# # PyBoss

# ![Boss](Images/boss.jpg)
# In this challenge, you get to be the _boss_. 
# You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. 
# Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation.
# The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.
# Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. 
# 
# Your script will need to do the following:

# * Import the `employee_data.csv` file, which currently holds employee records like the below:
# ```csv
# Emp ID,Name,DOB,SSN,State
# 214,Sarah Simpson,1985-12-04,282-01-8166,Florida
# 15,Samantha Lara,1993-09-08,848-80-7526,Colorado
# 411,Stacy Charles,1957-12-20,658-75-8526,Pennsylvania
# ```

# * Then convert and export the data to use the following format instead:
# ```csv
# Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
# 214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
# 15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
# 411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA
# ```

# * In summary, the required conversions are as follows:
#   * The `Name` column should be split into separate `First Name` and `Last Name` columns.
#   * The `DOB` data should be re-written into `MM/DD/YYYY` format.
#   * The `SSN` data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
#   * The `State` data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
